There are many data analysis tools available to the python analyst and it can be challenging to know which ones to use in a particular situation. A useful (but somewhat overlooked) technique is called association analysis which attempts to find common patterns of items in large data sets. One specific application is often called market basket analysis. The most commonly cited example of market basket analysis is the so-called “beer and diapers” case. The basic story is that a large retailer was able to mine their transaction data and find an unexpected purchase pattern of individuals that were buying beer and baby diapers at the same time.

For this case, we'll use data from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/Online%20Retail.xlsx
